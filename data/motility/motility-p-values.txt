This file was generated from the R script located in the project directory at ./code/figure-1_motility.R.
The contents of the file contain the p-values for the comparisons of motility velocities within a pCa.
There are two groups, actin vs biotin-actin.
The results follow: 

pCa 4


	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  Mean v [nm/sec] by actin
W = 9156, p-value = 0.5343
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0


 pCa 6.25 

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  Mean v [nm/sec] by actin
W = 8392.5, p-value = 0.8992
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0


 pCa 9 

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  Mean v [nm/sec] by actin
W = 1929.5, p-value = 0.933
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
